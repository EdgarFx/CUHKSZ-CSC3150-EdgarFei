# CUHKSZ-CSC3150-EdgarFei
cuhksz csc3150 operating system projects

Record the project I have done. It would be great if it can help the students in need (remember not to copy directly, personally suggest that if you have no ideas, you can look at the code here to find ideas, and then try to write it in your own way). Here are all the codes and reports of my four projects in the CSC3150 course, and the codes are all implemented in java. The scores of my four projects are all full marks, you should be able to rest assured (but not sure if there are bugs that have not been tested).

* Project1: User mode and Kernel mode + bonus: pstree.
* Project2: Frog crosses river + bonus: thread pool.
* Project3: Simulate a mechanism of virtual memory via GPU's memory + bonus: multiple threads in kernel with modified paging mechanism.
* Project4: Implement a mechanism of file system management via GPU's memory + bonus: tree-structured directories.
